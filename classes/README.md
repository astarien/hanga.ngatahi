# Pipeline Classes

There three general types of Pipeline class objects

- **Processors** which handle processing a pipeline
- **Implementers** which implement handling of a pipeline stage
- **Implementeds** which wrap the data and configuration for each stage for passing to the next

There is also a root **Object** class and we may need a **Implemntables** category for the Exporting stage

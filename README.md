***This is the main repository for the Hanga Ngatahi (AoG Data Pipelines) Project***

Hanga Ngatahi "Build it Together" is a project and programme for promoting the collaborative construction of data science units and the use of data science as as service.
The purpose is to build software and workflows to enable any group in the community to establish themselves as a modern data science unit. In New Zealand this includes all members of the community including the iwi and general tangata whenua "people of the land" and this programme follows the principles of Te Tiriti.

There are a number streams (sub-projects) including:

- The NLP Pipeline - software and workflows to process textual data
- The Graph Pipeline - software and workflows to convert relationships in data into graphs
- The Path Analysis Pipeline - software and workflows to convert data into nodes and flows to be visualized in Sankey diagrams
- The Document Pipeline - software and workflows to convert documents from unstructured format to structured/tabular format and maintain data content across forms

More streams may be added.

This project is owned by the community under the GPL 3.0. It was first established on Friday 30th July 2021 at 5:41pm.
